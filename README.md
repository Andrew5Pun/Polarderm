# polarizer-device
3D schematics of my polarizer device. The device was part of [my project] (https://makeprojects.com/ysc/project/using-ai-and-polarized-imaging-to-assist-physicians-with-early-skin-cancer-diagnosis) in the YSC 2020 Online STEM Fair.

# prototype models/later prototypes
Final design is [polarizer_device.stl] (/polarizer-device/blob/master/polarizer_device.stl)

# prototype models/later prototypes
Prototype models are early 3D printed parts that are not present in the final design.
